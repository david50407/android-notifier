The code in this package is a stripped-down version of that found in the official Android source base:

http://android.git.kernel.org/?p=platform/frameworks/base.git;a=tree;f=core/java/com/google/android/mms/pdu;hb=HEAD

As such, it's licensed under Android's Apache license, according to their headers.

It was not used directly from the framework because it's hidden :(
